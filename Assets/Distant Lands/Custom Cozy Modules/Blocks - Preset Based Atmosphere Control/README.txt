Thank you for downloading BLOCKS: Atmosphere Control Module! 

To use this module, simply add the Blocks module to the COZY Weather Sphere by selecting the module from the dropdown in the Modules folder of the Settings & Modules tab. COZY’s atmosphere will be overridden by BLOCKS and all default atmosphere colors will be disregarded at runtime. 
When creating a new block, use the simple block style to quickly set colors using a short list of parameters, then use the advanced block style to fine-tune all of the details.

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, don’t hesitate to contact me at distantlands.productions@gmail.com or via our Discord server!
